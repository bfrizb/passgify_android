Passgify
====================================================

A tool to deterministically generate pseudo-random passwords.

I wrote this code probably back in 2014 (I think?) and haven't kept it updated since then.

This Android App is accompanied by a Python implementation of Passgify that can be found [here](https://github.com/bfrizb/passgify). Please visit this Github project for more information.
